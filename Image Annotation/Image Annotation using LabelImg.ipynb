    "### Image Annotation using CVAT\n",
    "<b>Objective:</b>\n",
    "To annotate a publicly available image dataset using CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) for object detection tasks.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Step 1 : Selecting a Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I used a kaggle dataset \"Chess Pieces Detection Images Dataset\" by Anshul Mehta. This data set contains images of chess pieces like the queen, bishop etc. As this dataset contains 651 images, it is quite time consuming for me to label all of them so I took a subset of the images randomly containing 50 images. This is enough for me to gain proper understanding of the Annotation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2 : Setting Up CVAT\n",
    "\n",
    "CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) is a free, open-source web-based tool for annotating images and videos for computer vision tasks. It's more modern and feature-rich compared to desktop alternatives, offering better compatibility across different operating systems and architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with CVAT:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visit https://cvat.org and create a free account\n",
    "2. Log in to your account\n",
    "3. Create a new project for chess piece annotation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Creating YOLO Format Annotations with CVAT\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO (You Only Look Once) is one of the most popular object detection models, and CVAT allows you to export annotations in the YOLO format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up your task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on 'Create new task'\n",
    "2. Upload your selected 50 chess piece images\n",
    "3. Set up labels for different chess pieces (queen, bishop, pawn, etc.)\n",
    "4. Select 'Rectangle' as the annotation shape for bounding boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotating Images:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the task and start annotating\n",
    "2. For each image:\n",
    "   - Draw bounding boxes around chess pieces using the rectangle tool\n",
    "   - Select the appropriate label for each box (e.g., \"queen,\" \"bishop,\" \"pawn\")\n",
    "   - Use keyboard shortcuts (W for creating a box, N for next image) to speed up annotation\n",
    "3. Save your progress regularly\n",
    "\n",
    "Exporting Annotations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Once finished, click on 'Menu' → 'Export task dataset'\n",
    "2. Select 'YOLO' as the export format\n",
    "3. Download the exported annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "The exported package will contain:\n",
    "- A `obj.names` file listing all your classes\n",
    "- `.txt` files for each image with YOLO format annotations\n",
    "- A `train.txt` file listing all image paths\n",
    "\n",
    "CVAT Advantages:\n",
    "- Web-based: No installation or compatibility issues\n",
    "- Modern interface with better UX\n",
    "- Collaborative features for team projects\n",
    "- Multiple export formats supported\n",
    "- Built-in quality control tools\n",
    "- Regular backups of your annotations"

    "\n",
    "CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) is a free, open-source web-based tool for annotating images and videos for computer vision tasks. I organized my annotation project as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Created a CVAT account at https://cvat.org\n",
    "2. Set up a project with the following chess piece labels:\n",
    "   - Queen (color: #80765d)\n",
    "   - Bishop (color: #fdd8e4)\n",
    "   - Rook (color: #b3ed40)\n",

    "│ ├── train.txt # List of image paths\n",

    "2. Annotation Guidelines:\n",
    "   - Drew bounding boxes around each chess piece\n",
    "   - Labeled each piece according to its type (Queen, Bishop, Rook, Knight, Pawn)\n",
    "   - Used keyboard shortcuts for efficient annotation:\n",
    "     - W: Create a box\n",
    "     - N: Next image\n",
    "     - Ctrl+S: Save progress\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Quality Control:\n",
    "   - Reviewed annotations for accuracy\n",
    "   - Ensured consistent bounding box sizes\n",
    "   - Verified correct label assignments\n",

    "   - Contains detailed metadata including:\n",
    "     - Image dimensions\n",
    "     - Bounding box coordinates\n",
    "     - Label information\n",
    "     - Creation timestamps\n",

    "     - obj.data: Configuration file with class count and paths\n",
    "     - obj_train_data/: Directory with per-image annotations\n",
    "     - train.txt: List of image paths for training\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results and Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "- Successfully annotated the chess piece dataset\n",
    "- Generated both XML and YOLO format annotations\n",
