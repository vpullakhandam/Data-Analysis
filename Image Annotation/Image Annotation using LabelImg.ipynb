    "### Image Annotation using LabelImg\n",
    "<b>Objective:</b>\n",
    "To annotate a publicly available image dataset (e.g., COCO or Pascal VOC) using LabelImg for object detection tasks.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Step 1 : Selecting a Dataset\n",
    " \n",
    "We need to choose a dataset that is publicly available for image annotation. Some popular choices include:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>COCO (Common Objects in Context):</b> Contains images of complex everyday scenes with common objects in their natural contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Pascal VOC:</b> Includes images from various object classes, including people, animals, and vehicles, with detailed annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " For this project, I chose the Pascal VOC dataset, which includes a variety of objects such as people, cars, and animals. The dataset is commonly used in object detection tasks, making it a suitable choice for this project. The diversity of objects allows for the demonstration of various annotation challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2 : Install and Set Up LabelImg\n",
    "\n",
    "LabelImg is a free, open-source software program for labeling images using graphs. The software was released by Tzutalin in 2015 and written in Python; using QT for its GI (graphical interface). LabelImg is a straightforward and basic tool to label a few hundred images to create a dataset for computer vision model training.\n",
